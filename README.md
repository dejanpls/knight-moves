## Knight Moves in JavaScript

The task was to build a function knightMoves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

## Example Usage

```txt
  knightMoves([3,3],[4,3])
  You made it in 3 moves! Here's your path:

    [3,3]
    [4,5]
    [2,4]
    [4,3]
```

## Building your own knightMoves helps you learn:

- Graph modeling without creating a formal graph class.

- Implementing and customizing a BFS for spatial movement.

- Designing systems that return not just “an answer” but the path to the answer.

- Understanding how to work within constraints (board size, movement rules).

## Important to Note

- This is a learning project inspired by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
- Built using modern JavaScript (ES2022+), including classes and optional private helpers.
- No external libraries or dependencies required.
